# 📄 ChatPDF – AI-Powered PDF Q&A System

ChatPDF is a fully functional, production-ready **full-stack application** that enables users to upload PDFs and interact with them using **AI-powered question answering**. This project is built with a modern stack and showcases my capability to architect, develop, and deploy an end-to-end system.

## 💡 Why This Stack?

I've been using **Node.js** extensively and chose it here to demonstrate my expertise in building **scalable, production-level applications** using JavaScript/TypeScript across the stack.

To implement document Q\&A, I used **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — a modern architecture where PDF content is split, embedded using **OpenAI**, and stored in **Pinecone**, a vector database. This enabled:

- Accurate **semantic similarity search**
- Scalable, blazing fast response times
- A structured way to retrieve relevant content per question

This project is more than a tech demo — it's a real-world architecture designed to be **deployable and extensible**.
